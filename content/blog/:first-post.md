The hope for these posts is to go through Project Euler problems 1-100. I'm aware this has been done before, and I don't particulary care. These first 15 are pretty trivial so they don't take long.

## Problem 1: Mutliples of 3 and 5


> *If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.* 

>  *Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.* 

Theres a very pythonic solution for this but it's not algorithmicaly "nice". 

```python
#Takes 0.02s user 0.01s system 87% cpu 0.038 total
print(sum([i for i in range(1000) if i % 3 == 0 and i % 5 == 0])) 
```
Simply, it sums an array generated using a list comprehension. However this would be O(2n) and we can definately do better than that. 


## Problem 2: Even Fibonacci numbers

> *Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:*

> *1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...*

> *By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.*

```python
